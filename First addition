We measure many aspects of technology performance numerically, from the amount of gas  a vehicle consumes per mile to the number of transistors per square inch of an integrated circuit. We track the changes of these numerical features over time, and use historical rates of change to predict future performance. Of course, we cannot take for granted that the numerical features in question will continue to change at the same rate; generally, the representations we arrive at have required massive simplification of a complex technical phenomenon. Our technical progression may run into any number of limiting factors, for example. These can be physical, economic, political, or some combination thereof (and of course this is by no means an exhaustive list). Consider, for example, the possibility that we are now reaching a level of environmental depletion that could change the game entirely, destabilizing the flows of materials, resources, and expertise that have made the rapid technological advances of the past century possible.

The possible is infinitely larger than the actual. We can imagine it as the power set of the actual, the set of all possible subsets of the actual, which is itself an infinite set of sets of things. To the possible belongs every possible action by every possible actor.
